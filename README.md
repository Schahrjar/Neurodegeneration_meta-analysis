# Neurodegeneration GWAS meta-analysis
This is a developing platform for analysis of genotype data and GWAS summary statistics on neurodegenerative diseases. With a growing number of genotyping data on neurodegerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, we aim at constructing a platform for a clean aggregation of these genotype and sumstats data to make a cohort inclusive of diverse ethnicities. This way can better visualise the spectrum of human neurodegeration.

> [!NOTE]
> The concept of merging and QCing the genotype and sumstats data should be the same among various GWASs. Thus, you may use this in other GWASs on other traits rather than the neurodegeneration.
